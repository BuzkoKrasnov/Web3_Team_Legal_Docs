each individually referred to as a “**Party**” and together as the
“**Parties**”.

**RECITALS:**

1)  Principal has a certain amount of crypto assets in its possession
    and is looking to effectively manage such funds.

2)  Agent is currently employed or sub-contracted by Principal or one of
    the Principal’s affiliates and has certain skills and knowledge in
    the area of crypto assets, and Principal is willing to engage Agent
    to assist with certain transactions with crypto assets.

**NOW, THEREFORE**, in consideration for the mutual covenants contained
in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
Parties agree as follows:

1.  **Appointment**. Principal hereby appoints Agent to manage Bitcoin
    (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ether (ETH), Ether Classic (ETC),
    Litecoin (LTC), or any other digital assets belonging to Principal
    (“**Crypto Funds**”) and Agent agrees to the appointment and
    undertakes to manage such Crypto Funds for the benefit of Principal.

2.  **General Mandate**. Agent will manage Crypto Funds in accordance
    with the instructions of Principal on a non-discretionary basis.
    Such instructions may be communicated to Agent in any manner agreed
    by the Parties, including, via email, messenger, or by phone. Agent
    will be bound by the duties of care and loyalty to Principal. All
    income, profit and loss resulting from the management of Crypto
    Funds shall be for the account of Principal. The mandate shall
    commence upon the date when Agent receives the first transfer of
    Crypto Funds.

3.  **Fees**. Agent’s fees are included in the salary for its employment
    or subcontract with Principal or one of the Principal’s affiliates.

4.  **Procedure**. Subject to other provisions of this Agreement, the
    Parties agree to comply with the following procedures:

    1.  (a) At the instructions of Principal, Agent will open in its own
        name one or several accounts with reputable centralized crypto
        currency platforms or exchanges and inform Principal of such
        accounts’ details.

    2.  (b) At the instructions of Principal, Agent will open one or several
        accounts or wallets, such as Metamask, for various blockchains
        and inform Principal of such accounts’ details.

    3.  (c) At the instructions of Principal, Agent acting together with
        Principal will open a multi-signature wallet with Gnosis Safe
        ([<u>https://gnosis-safe.io/</u>](https://gnosis-safe.io/))
        where each of the Parties will have certain rights as will be
        further determined by Principal.

    4.  (d) Principal will, from time to time, transfer the Crypto Funds to
        such accounts of Agent, of which Principal will inform Agent in
        advance.

    5.  (e) Simultaneously with transferring the Crypto Funds or thereafter,
        Principal will provide Agent with instructions on how to manage
        the Crypto Funds. Such instructions may include but are not
        limited to: (i) conversion to fiat currencies, (ii) transfer to
        third parties, (iii) investments into other digital assets, (iv)
        staking, farming, locking or other transactions with the Crypto
        Funds, and any other instructions relating to legitimate
        commercial needs and investment objectives of Principal.

    6.  (f) Agent must follow the instructions of Principal precisely. If
        this is not possible for any reason, Agent will immediately
        consult with Principal. If there is a portion of the Crypto
        Funds with respect to which no instructions have been issued by
        Principal, Agent shall refrain from any operations with such
        Crypto Funds.

5.  **Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Audit**. Agent will record all
    transactions with the Crypto Funds by making complete and correct
    entries into a Google Sheets document (“**Report**”), which shall at
    least include the following information: (i) transaction date; (ii)
    transaction currency; (iii) quantity; (iv) purpose of
    transaction; (v) recipient; and (vi) supporting documentation, to
    the extent possible. The Report shall also include other information
    corresponding to the nature of a transaction in question (for
    example, a trading position shall include a position open date and
    price, a position closing date and price, and resulting profit or
    loss). Each transaction shall be reflected in the Report within 12
    hours of its execution. Principal shall always have access to the
    Report. When keeping track of the transactions is not feasible in
    the Report, Agent will maintain sufficiently detailed logs of
    transactions in a shared Notion page.

6.  **Duration and Termination**. This Agreement is entered into for a
    term of one year, after which the Agreement will automatically renew
    on its anniversary date for the same term, unless one of the Parties
    provides a 5-days’ written notice prior to any such anniversary date
    that the Agreement shall not renew. The same applies to subsequent
    terms. Principal is entitled to terminate this Agreement with
    immediate effect at any time during the term of the Agreement by
    giving a notice to Agent. Agent is entitled to terminate this
    Agreement by giving a 10-days’ notice to Principal.

7.  **Return of Funds**. At the instructions of Principal, in event of
    termination or any time during the term of this Agreement, Agent
    will return to Principal part or all of the Crypto Funds held by
    Agent or to which Agent has otherwise access due to the performance
    of this Agreement, including, without limitation, tokens to which
    Agent is entitled due to its interaction with crypto-related
    projects using the Crypto Funds, such as airdrops, tokens from hard
    forks, proceeds or payments due to the participation in various
    blockchain protocols.

8.  **Security Measures**. Agent will take reasonable measures to secure
    the Crypto Funds, including using cybersecurity and good trading and
    custody practices. Agent will be liable to Principal for any losses
    of the Crypto Funds resulting from the Agent’s failure to take such
    security measures. Principal is entitled to request private keys or
    login credentials to the Agent’s accounts and digital wallets, which
    have been opened at the instruction of Principal or where the Crypto
    Funds are stored otherwise.

9.  **Tax Liability**. Each Party is responsible for payment of taxes on
    any income it derives during the performance of this Agreement.
    Unless otherwise is agreed in the employment agreement or other
    contract between the Parties, Principal will not be liable for the
    payment of any taxes, social contribution payments or similar
    payments which Agent must pay individually. Taxes and fees in
    connection with the implementation of the Principal’s instructions
    for making transactions with the Crypto Funds are paid at the
    expense of Principal.

10. **Costs**. Agent will bear expenses relating to the management of
    the Crypto Funds and is entitled to the reimbursement of such
    reasonable expenses. Such expenses shall be reflected in the Report
    and accompanied by supporting documentation (such as invoices,
    payment statements, etc.). Any expenses exceeding $200 per month
    must be approved by Principal in advance.

11. **Conflicts of Interest**. Agent undertakes to disclose to Principal
    all conflicts of interest, actual or potential, as soon as Agent
    becomes aware of them. In the event of any doubts as to the
    existence of a conflict of interest or as to the meaning or scope of
    this Agreement, Agent shall immediately contact Principal for

    relationship between the Parties in this respect will at all times
    be that of independent contractors.
