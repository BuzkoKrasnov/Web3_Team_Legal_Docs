This FAST Token Addendum (“**Addendum**”) is entered into as of the date
set forth on the signature page by and between the undersigned company
(“**Company**”) and the undersigned advisor (“**Advisor**”) to
supplement the Founder Advisor Standard Template (“**FAST**”) entered by
and between the Company and the Advisor in the past.

<u>Definitions</u>

Capitalized terms that are not otherwise defined in this Addendum have
the following meaning.

“**Advisor Wallet**” is the following {`Ethereum`} network address:
{`WALLET ADDRESS`}.

“**Company Tokens**” are Tokens issued by the Company.

“**Delivery Date**” is (1) the date when compensation of the Advisor
shall be paid according to FAST, or (2) if this Addendum is signed after
such date, the date of the latest signature on this Addendum, but in any
case not earlier than Qualifying Token Sale.

“**Equity Tokens**” are a subset of Company Tokens issued to the
Company’s directors, officers, employees, advisors, or existing equity
investors of the Company.

“**Tokens**” are (1) cryptocurrencies, decentralized application tokens,
protocol tokens, cryptographic digital tokens or coins, virtual
currencies, blockchain-based assets or any other similar digital assets,
(2) instruments or securities exchangeable, exercisable or convertible
into the items in the foregoing clause (1), or (3) instruments,
securities, documents, agreements, understandings, contracts or
arrangements that provide for the right to receive the items in the
foregoing clause (1), including without limitation “Rights to Future
Tokens,” “Future Token Interests,” or “Simple Agreements for Future
Tokens”.

“**Qualifying Token Sale**” means the next bona fide sale of Company
Tokens in exchange for a delivery of purchase price, a contribution, or
any other items of value, including other Tokens, for capital raising
purposes, negotiated on an arms-length basis, primarily to third parties
who are not directors, officers, employees, advisors or existing equity
investors in the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, a Qualifying Token
Sae shall not include (i) any “seed round allocation” of Company Tokens
or rights to Company Tokens, (ii) an allocation of Company Tokens or
rights to Company Tokens by the Company at no cost or at de minimis
cost, (iii) an issuance of Company Tokens or rights to Company Tokens
where the aggregate proceeds are less than ${`1,070,000`} value for all
Company Tokens and rights to Company Tokens sold, (iv) the sale of
Company Tokens to a digital asset exchange in connection with an initial
listing or (v) direct sale of Company Tokens with Simple Agreement for
Future Tokens (“**SAFT**”).

<u>1. Token Compensation</u>

For services described in the FAST and in addition to any compensation
under the FAST, subject to the terms defined below, if a Qualifying
Token Sale occurs, the Advisor is entitled to receive free of any charge
that portion of the Equity Tokens equal to the ratio of (a) the number
of shares of the Company’s common stock issued or issuable to the
Advisor under the FAST, to (b) the total number of shares of the
Company’s common stock on a fully-diluted basis (“**Advisor Tokens**”).

<u>2. Token Delivery</u>

2.1. On the Delivery Date, the Company shall transfer the exact number
of Advisor Tokens to the Advisor Wallet free of any fees (including gas
fees), subject to the limitations in Section 3 below.

<u>3. Token Lockup</u>

3.1. Acknowledgement. The Advisor Tokens are subject to the restrictions
set forth in this Section 3 (collectively, the “**Lockup**”). The Lockup
shall be applicable to the Advisor only if applied pari passu to all
employees {`(not including third-party contractors)`}, officers,
directors, stockholders, and SAFT investors of the Company. To the
extent permitted by the applicable law, any waiver or termination of the
Lockup by the Company shall apply pari passu to the Advisor.

3.2. Lockup. The Advisor agrees that it will not transfer any Advisor
Tokens unless such transfer is in accordance with the release schedule
set forth below (each such date, respectively, a “**Release Date**”):

-   {`33`}% of the Advisor Tokens are released from the Lockup
    restrictions on the {`sixth month`} anniversary of the Qualifying
    Token Sale;

-   {`33`}% of the Advisor Tokens shall be released from the Lockup
    restrictions on the {`twelfth month`} anniversary of the Qualifying
    Token Sale; and

-   {`34`}% of the Advisor Tokens shall be released from the Lockup
    restrictions on the {`eighteenth month`} anniversary of the Qualifying
    Token Sale.

Notwithstanding the Lockup, the Advisor may stake its Advisor Tokens in
accordance with the whitepaper applicable to the Tokens, available at
{`URL`} (“**Staking Mechanism**”). The Advisor agrees that any Tokens
distributed to the Advisor pursuant to the staking mechanism (the
“**Staking Rewards**”) will also be subject to Lockup restrictions;
provided that 100% of the Staking Rewards shall be released from the
Lockup on the {`eighteenth month`} anniversary of the Qualifying Token
Sale.
